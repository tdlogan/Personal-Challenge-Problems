/*
Write a function that generates every sequence of throws a single
player could throw over a three-round game of rock-paper-scissors.

Your output should look something like:
   [["rock", "rock", "rock"],
    ["rock", "rock", "paper"],
    ["rock", "rock", "scissors"],
    ["rock", "paper", "rock"],
            ...etc...
     ]

Extra credit:
   - Make your function return answers for any number of rounds, but default
to three rounds if no parameters are given.

Example:
rockPaperScissors(5); // => [['rock', 'rock', 'rock', 'rock', 'rock'], etc...]

*/

let rockPaperScissors => (rounds) {

};
