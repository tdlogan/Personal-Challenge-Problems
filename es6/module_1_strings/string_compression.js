//Compress a string by creating a method that returns a compressed form the of the given string. 
//If the given string is longer after the compression is attempted, return the original string instead.
//Example: "aaabbcccc".stringCompression(); -> "a3b2c4" 
//Example: "a".stringCompression(); -> "a" would be returned, not "a1"
